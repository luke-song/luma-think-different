# Story

Think Different Page is about a boy who dropped out. Embark on an interactive journey that traces the path of a college dropout who transformed the world with his unique vision. The story begins with the pivotal moment of leaving formal education, symbolized by a fading phrase, “Once upon a time, one college student dropped out.” This marks the start of an unconventional path towards groundbreaking innovations.

Interactivity:
The webpage features a section titled "MerryGoAround," showcasing 3D animations created with React Spring, illustrating the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of innovation. Users are then led to a segment highlighting the dropout's encounter with calligraphy, emphasizing the fusion of art and technology in his later creations.

Animations and Visuals:
The page includes an engaging "Hello World!" section with Leo-font-animation, symbolizing the first steps in programming and technology. An optional interactive 3D image of a sliding Macintosh computer is presented, offering a zoom-in perspective and an interactive monitor, underscoring the revolutionary impact of personal computing.

Tribute Section:
A special tribute to Steve Jobs is envisaged with an optional interactive portrait.
This section includes a random Steve Jobs quote generator, adding an element of surprise and inspiration for the visitors.
The famous quote,
“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards..."
is prominently featured, encapsulating the essence of his philosophy.

Educational Element:
The webpage plans to have an optional learning section about serif fonts and handwriting, tying back to the influence of calligraphy on Steve Jobs' approach to design and aesthetics.
